            Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence
            demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and
            animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any
            device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of
            successfully achieving its goals.
